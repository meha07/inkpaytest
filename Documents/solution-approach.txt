### installed the create-react-app (CRA) npm package Â globally on my machine using the following command

	npm install -g create-react-appeact-app

### create our React App after installing the globally using the following command

	npx create-react-app inkpay

### After installing react app the basics structure was ready. Hence, after that, I installed react-dom for managing the dom specific operations like render() and react-router-dom for implementing routing process.


### Created two components named home_page.js, counter_page.js

### Implemented navigation between these two pages using < Router />, <Switch /> and <NavLink />. Used switch router since it does not render inclusively and is useful in case of nesting navigation requirement. 

### Used Navlink to add active class on the selected element.

### Used exact on home route to ensure that don't render inclusively

###installed redux for maintaining the state of counters

### created increment in App.js function for maintaining the state and passed the state as props to the Home and Counter Components.
